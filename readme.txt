BadgeOS Add-On to reset BadgeOS data in your database.

== Description ==

The "BadgeOS Reset Developer Add-On" is an extension that cleans up and removes as much BadgeOS data from the your database that it can accurately detect. This way, you can "start over" with a clean database while you are developing your achievement-based website or course.

This is a plugin you should not leave active longer than you need, to prevent accidentally deleting your data when you do not intend to. Also, ALWAYS back up your database before use, just to be safe.

Note: This Add-on requires the free BadgeOS plugin. [Get the BadgeOS plugin](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/badgeos/ "BadgeOS").
